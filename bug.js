The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to data retrieval and asynchronous operations.  It attempts to access data from a Firebase Realtime Database query before the data has fully loaded, resulting in undefined values or unexpected behavior.

```javascript
const database = firebase.database();
const ref = database.ref('myData');

ref.once('value').then(snapshot => {
  const data = snapshot.val();
  console.log(data.someProperty); // This might cause an error
});

// Trying to use data before it's loaded
console.log(data); // data is undefined here because the query is asynchronous
```
